    <h2>Hi there, I'm Heber!</h2><br><br><br>
    <p>
        Welcome to my Portfolio.<br>
        I am an extroverted, proactive, and creative Brazilian professional who is passionate about leveraging technology to make the world a better place. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at CCT Dublin, where I have honed my skills in programming, web development, and project management.
        As an aspiring IT professional, I am eager to gain hands-on experience in the industry and am actively seeking opportunities to work on innovative projects that challenge me to learn and grow. I have completed several internships and freelance projects where I have gained practical experience working with clients, developing custom solutions, and managing projects from start to finish.
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in photography, traveling, and trying new things. I believe that experiencing new cultures and learning about different perspectives is essential for personal and professional growth. Whether it's hiking in the mountains or trying new food, I am always up for an adventure.
        I pride myself on my ability to communicate effectively with others and believe that my extroverted personality and enthusiasm for life make me a great fit for any team. I am a strong believer in collaboration and believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute.<br>
